# **HunguryMonkey**
* This repo contains a game developed with js.

## **Getting Started**
Hello Everyone
* I designed a web game using HTML, CSS and Java Script. This game basically involves collecting objects with inputs and getting a score.
* Details about the game are given below.
Have fun player :)

### **Gameplay**
* The gameplay of the monkey game is quite simple.
* When you access the game website, you must first select the game mode (be patient, I will explain the modes ).
* You must then confirm the alert messages displayed.
* Here you are ready for the Monkey game!
* After that, all you have to do is make the monkey jump with the up arrow key or mouse click.
* If you want to move your monkey on the horizontal axis, you can also use the right (->) and left (<-) arrow keys.

### **Modes**
* There are two modes in the game.
1. Against to Time Mode:
  * In Against to time, you basically have to collect as many bananas as you can within the 1 minute given to you.
2. Normal Mode:
  * You don't have any time limit in normal mode. The aim in this mode is to collect as many bananas as possible.

### **Game Rules**
* If the monkey falls to the ground, the game is over.
* If you run out of time in Against to time mode, the game is over.
